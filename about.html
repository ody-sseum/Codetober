                <h1>The One Shot Look-See</h1>
                At One Shot, we serve more than just coffee—we serve strength in a cup. Founded in 2023 by former competitive gamer Jake “Tank” Lawson and coffee expert Isabella Cortez, One Shot was born out of a need for something stronger, bolder, and built to last through the night. Whether you’re pulling all-nighters, grinding through a tough project, or just living life on the edge, our powerful brews will keep you in the game.

                <h1>Our "Punch"</h1>
                With a rugged, no-nonsense atmosphere that screams "rough and tough," One Shot offers a unique blend of strength and nostalgia, drawing inspiration from the classic pixelated worlds of old-school gaming. From the coffee beans we hand-pick to the pixel art that lines our walls, we’ve crafted an experience that powers you up in more ways than one.

                <h1>Closing</h1>
                We’re not just here to wake you up—we’re here to fuel your ambitions. Step into One Shot, take a seat, and prepare to Fight the Night with the strongest cup in town.
